FlatList vs ScrollView

It's a big difference with FlatList and ScrollView

ScrollView will load items (data in it for scrolling) immediately after component loading.
So all data will mount into RAM and you can't use hundred or thousand items in it (because of low performance).

But FlatList has a better solution for this issue, it will mount 10 items (by default) to screen,
if user scroll view so other items will mount. It's a big gain of FlatList instead of ScrollView.

you can use ScrollView in small items (like 100 items) and FlatList fro even 10000 items.

React Navigation

React Native doesn't have a built-in idea of a global history stack like a web browser does
-- this is where React Navigation enters the story.

'NavigationContainer' is a component which manages our navigation tree and contains the navigation state.
